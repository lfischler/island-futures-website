The best way to contact me is over email.
You can also find me on Twitter at @leannefischler and on Mastodon @leannefischler.
I’m on LinkedIn at Leanne Fischler—but don’t like wearing such a fancy hat.
As I continue to develop my data engineering skills, you’ll find some of my work under @lfischler on GitHub.
I’m frequently visiting Glasgow, Edinburgh and, occasionally, London. I’m up for a walk and a chat and enjoy meeting interesting folk. If you’re visiting Orkney, then absolutely don’t leave without saying “hello”!
