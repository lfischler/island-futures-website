## Project Overview
We have succumbed to an age where the value of money has deteriorated and society as a whole has become materialistic and object-orientated.

‘Excuse me? Excuse you!’ is an attentive character. Embodied within a hand crafted messenger bag, its evocative whispers make spending money emotionally harder. Inverting the value given to consumerism, the concept creates a negative association with spending.

With every scuff in the leather, your relationship with the bag grows; it is a piece of fashion that never becomes obsolete. Although cheeky and critical, ‘Excuse me? Excuse you!’ is an old friend looking out for our best interests.

## Project Context
This project was created as part of a university module exploring the potential for design to prompt critical thought. We wanted to explore the contrast between mass production, consumerism and wellbeing. 

## Publicity
Over a year after the Anti-Consumerist Handbag was completed and exhibited, my collaborators and I did a short interview on a radio show as part of an event. During this interview, we mentioned the design and the meaning behind it. The next day, we were surprised to get a message saying that our faces were on the front cover of the Metro. The design had been picked up by a number of mass media sources and was scattered across newspapers throughout the country. This led to an interview for Radio 4 and an invitation to visit a TV studio in London to speak about our work.

## The Process

![the handbag technology](/images/handbag-wip.jpg)
The prototype handbag was built using Arduino in combination with a sensor that would sense when the debit card was removed. A sound clip was then played to attempt to deter the user from making the purchase.

The handbag was created using my father's old bookbinding leather. We used a sailmakers' stich to create the design.
