## The Context
During lockdown, 2020, I found myself living in Orkney and working for London-based design studio, Superflux. I'd been tasked to create a series of sculptural culterly items as part of their work for Venice Biennale Di Archittetura. The pieces below were crafted from materials found in Orkney's (limited) woodlands; on Orkney's beaches; and sourced from the homes of friends on the islands.

"Refuge for Resurgence considers how all forms of life on earth might come together around a dinner table to celebrate their ecological interdependence in a post-Anthropocene world â€“ a symbolic home where all species can prosper with resilience, adaptation, and hope. Occupying a space beneath the arches of the Arsenale, Refuge For Resurgence presents a magnificent 4m-long table, hand-made in Didcot from the wood of a wild Surrey oak. Placed around the table are fourteen wooden stools, and on it fourteen unique table settings, each carefully customised for the creature it is intended for." - [Superflux](https://superflux.in/index.php/tag/refuge-for-resurgence/#)

These works were created as part of Superflux's 2021 work _[Refuge for Resurgence](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/refuge-for-resurgence/#)_. I've decided to exhibit them in their own right but am hesitant to do so as they exist as part of this wider creative exploration and context. As such, I'd like to acknowledge the creative contributions of my collaborators who informed, inspired, reviewed my process: Jon Ardern, Anab Jain, Nicola Ferrao, Ed Lewis, Matthew Edgson, Cream Studios, Gareth Huw Lewis.
