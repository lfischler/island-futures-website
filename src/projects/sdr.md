### Problem Solved
The Scottish Design Relay is one of V&A Museum of Designâ€™s first nation-wide community engagement projects. The project travelled to six locations across Scotland carrying out a series of design workshops in each location inspired by the design heritage in that area.

I was asked by V&A Dundee to facilitate and run the workshops alongside a local designer in each location.
